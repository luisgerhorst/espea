# The Electrostatic Potential Evolutionary Algorithm

This implementation of the algorithm described in "Obtaining Optimal Pareto Front Approximations using Scalarized Preference Information" by Braun et al. was created as part of the seminar [Black Box Challenge](https://www.cs12.tf.fau.de/lehre/lehrveranstaltungen/seminare/black-box-challenge-meta-heuristic-optimization-for-arbitrary-problems/) at the [FAU](https://www.fau.de).

Refer to the report for an in-depth guide to understanding the code (chapter 3, Implementation).
